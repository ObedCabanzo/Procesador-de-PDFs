# Abstract
Mobile systems are always growing, automatically they need enough resources to secure them. Indeed, traditional techniques for protecting the mobile environment are no longer effective. We need to look for new mechanisms to protect the mobile environment from malicious behavior. In this paper, we examine one of the most popular systems, Android OS. Next, we will propose a distributed architecture based on IDS-AM to detect intrusions by mobile agents (IDS-AM).
Keywords— Android, IDS, IDS-AM, mobile agents, attacks.
# 1. INTRODUCTION
With the advent of the mobile operating system, including Android devices, the security threat is increasing and mobile security enhancement solutions that can mitigate the associated risk are lacking . So android devices have serious problems with malwares, in 2016 according to a recent report from Kaspersky Lab and INTERPOL, Android users would be prime targets for malware. Indeed, over 98% of detections Kaspersky Lab to Android . On an open market such as that of Android, the quality of applications is moderated by the user reviews . If an application is reported by some users as malware, Google removes this malicious application. Security is primarily based on the user should not install an application with a small number of comments or requesting not required permissions for the application . This paper proposes a methodology to automatically detect an intrusion (malware, virus, bug…) using IDS, that is an integral part of any complete security package of a modern. An IDS is used to detect the intrusions by supervising a network or a system and analyzes collected flows of audit .
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents some security issues in android environment, and we provide background overview information about the current status of security solutions in this platform. Then in section 3 we propose a solution that enables an Androphone to detect an intrusion using IDS based on new architecture that have three agents: monitoring, analyzing and reporting. And finally in section 4 we will show the test and result of implementation of this architecture in real environment.

# 2. Android Overview
Google Android is an open source Linux Based operating System, which allows modification on kernel level. Android consists of five layers of services :
1. Kernel layer based on Linux, it is closest to hardware.
2. Runtime layer contains a Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM) and each app operates in its own DVM.
3. Libraries are specific to hardware architecture on the device.
4. Framework layer implements application level services such as Inter-Process Communication (IPC).
5. The Application framework defines the creation and working of apps.
The following figure summarizes all this five layers .

# 2. Android security
Android security depends on different parts of the OS. It is built on top of a Linux kernel. Then, as each application runs as an independent process, isolation is guaranteed by the UNIX permissions of standard user processes. Each process contains an instance of the DVM that also provides some isolation between the application and the OS. Nevertheless, Android gives the ability to run native libraries that could endanger the system .

In the following paragraph, we discuss the results of the classification and the characteristics of Android malwares given in .
- Trojans look like a normal app, but they perform harmful behavior without knowledge of the users.
- Spyware may present itself as good applications, but has a hidden agenda to silently monitor contacts, messages, location etc. that leads to steal private data.
- Worm app can create similar copies of itself and spreads them through network and media.
- Backdoor authorize other malware to enter the system facilitating them the bypass of the normal security procedures.
- Botnet apps compromise the device to create a Bot, so that the device is controlled by Botmaster (remote server), called, through specific commands.
- Ransomware can lock the user device to make it inaccessible until some ransom amount is paid through online payment service.
As mentioned before, the approaches proved valuable in protecting Smartphones but they have a lot of restrictions. Most of the existing methods learn from traditional IDS. The special character of the Smartphone is not fully taken into account. Our presented approaches allow us to extract as many features as we would like. This makes the detection capability become more efficient. The intrusion detection system we proposed not only can find abnormality but also can locate the malware, and send reporting log to the system for taking appropriate measures, that are predefined. The main role of this solution is to detect a suspicious behavior in the system caused by malicious applications particularly malwares.
For this, we discover smartphone anomalies in real time, efficient selection and extraction of features are essential.
# 3. PROPOSED IDS ARCHITECTURE
In order to cope against abnormality particularly malwares, we proposed a new architecture of intrusion detection system. It is used to help users find the suspicious behavior on the Smartphones. The architecture of intrusion detection system based on the android platform can be seen on Figure 5.
As shown in Figure 5, the data extraction has three functional modules, namely, system status monitoring, network monitoring, and process monitoring. The system status monitoring module monitors real-time system behaviors, such as CPU usage, battery consumption, memory usage. We find indeed malware that can consume a lot of loads and traffic. The main work of the process monitoring module is extracting.
The characteristics of all processes running on the phone. This means information about applications running in real time so that we can find malicious applications that can damage the system or steal private data such as SMS, contacts, location, etc. The network monitoring module analyzes the incoming and outgoing network traffic On the smartphone, we can get the source IP address, the destination IP address, the protocol type (TCP / UDP / ICMP), the port number source and the destination port number. All this information is used to identify the creator of each network connection.
Data analysis uses a detection algorithm to determine if the Android system is an invasion. However, it is not enough to find the anomaly of the Android system. In order to further analyze the anomalies of the Android system and to locate malware, we also need to monitor the process and network traffic, providing data analysis for a more detailed data source.
# b. Agents of Data Analysis
The data analysis agent is the main element of the intrusion detection system. It analyzes the extracted data provided by the data extraction agents. It uses the Bayes algorithm to analyze and determine if there is abnormal behavior. First, based on the behavioral characteristics of the set of learning samples, we establish the normal behavior profile of the Android system. We then extract the behavior characteristics from the data needed to test and establish the current profile. And afterwards we make a comparison of the retained profile with the contour of the normal behavior. If it exceeds the established threshold, it is thought that there has been abnormal behavior. The intrusion detection system generates an alarm. The reporting process further, otherwise it is considered normal behavior. Indeed, this element can compare a normal behavior that is extracted by the Android system and an abnormal behavior that is extracted by one of the three elements of the extraction of data. We have therefore used a Naïve Bayes classifier which can affect the most likely class to a given example described by its feature vector.

have two possible values namely c1 = "normal" and c2 = "abnormal".
characteristics of the behavior of the Android system. Each element refers to feature of android system ( Xi→ i= 1,2…,n).
This classifier can calculate the maximum of two probabilities which are:
P(C =c1 | X =x): the probability x of occurrence of c1
P(C =c2 | X =x): the probability x of occurrence of c2
It means that will use this expression: Max{P(C =c1 | X =x), P(C=c2 | X=x)}
# c. Agents of Reporting
The reporting agent's main purpose is to present a report on the security of the Android system. There are two ways to report the positive and the passive relationship. Passive reports to present the normal behavior of the Android system. In the event of a serious threat, the alarm information is saved as a log file. Then the administrator analyzes the log and takes the appropriate measures. It means that we take a positive reporting approach and take the appropriate measures based on predefined rules, such as uninstall the application, terminate the process, cut off all wireless connections, encrypt the data, change the Firewall Policy etc.
In this paper, the intrusion detection system divides the reporting into two levels. We set log file according to the behavior of the android system. Once the phone was found to be invaded, the intrusion detection system alerts the user which would take the appropriate correction measures.
# 4. TEST AND RESULTS
locate the source of malware. This figure shows the result of extraction some information about process.
# 4. Test environment
JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment Framework) is a software Framework fully implemented in the Java language. JADE system supports coordination between several agents FIPA and provides a standard implementation of the communication language FIPA-ACL. In this section we will show how to start JADE platform and we will make agents communicate between them. Indeed in this test we will create five agents for each element of architecture.
# 4. Network monitoring Agent
Network monitoring agent (Netm) captures packets from different network interfaces and prepares these packets to send to the other agent, which can analyses information about the network such IP address to locate the source of malware. This figure shows the result of extraction some information about network.
Fig 6. Result of extraction IP address and Mac address
# 4. System state monitoring agent
System state monitoring agent (Sym) extracts features of physical elements from the system of Smartphone, such as CPU usage and memory usage and prepares these features to send to the other agent. This figure shows the result of extraction some information about system state.
Fig 7. Result of extraction CPU and Memory usage
# 4. Process monitoring agent
Process monitoring agent (Prm) extracts some information about processes such as ID, name, and prepares these data to send to the other agent, and to
# 4. Data analysis agent
Data analysis agent (AnalysisBNC) analyses the data which are sending by (Sym) using the Bayes naïve classifier, to detect anomalies in the system.
# 4. Reporting agent
Reporting agent (Report) alert the user of Smartphone using a message that a malicious application is running, so the user must take some correctives measures such as delete the malicious application or end a process …
# 4. Communication between mobile agents
In this proposed architecture, after the creation of agents, (Netm, Prm, Sym, AnalysisBNC, and Report) we must assure the communication between them, so JADE proposes ACL messages which are very simple to use. This figure shows the architecture of the proposed solution using agents and ACL messages for communication.
mentioned that the implementation of this work is in progress. Indeed the finale version of this paper will be done after we finish the evaluation of this solution.
The ACLMessage class represents messages which can be exchanged by the agents. When an agent wants to send a message, it must create a new object ACLMessage, and then call the send() method, which can send the message to the receiver. When an agent wants to receive a message, it must use the receive() method. The content of the messages is an interaction between mobile agents and their environments. In this case, the content is about traffic network, particularly IP address and the Mac address, system state such as CPU and memory usage, process such as ID process, and ACL message for displaying the result of analyze. The following figure shows the result of this test.
After analyzing Data which are from system state monitoring (Sym), the result of this analyze is sending to (Report) agent, in this case it displays that the comportment of system is abnormal.
# 5. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Smartphone security is becoming more and more serious. Intrusion detection systems for smartphones will become one of the interesting points of future research. In particular, malware for the Android system is also experiencing abnormal growth. Our future work using this architecture consists to complete the implementation by integrating the solution in Android System. And finally we
