# ABSTRACT
Smartphones apps aid humans in plenty of situations. There exists an app for everything. However, without the user’s awareness, some apps contain vulnerabilities or leak private data. Static and dynamic app analysis are ways to find these software properties. Especially setting up a dynamic analysis environment is not a trivial task. Several peculiarities of Android have to be considered, existing tools for different aspects have to be evaluated, selected and setup to work together. Existing literature is often outdated and only covers tools for one aspect but doesn’t combine them together in a big picture. This paper presents a generic design for an automated dynamic app analysis environment and highlights the required components as well as functionality to reveal security and privacy issues. Available tools are listed, realizing different aspects of the proposed environment design. Tool features are evaluated and tool usability for an automated large scale dynamic app analysis is compared. This document should serve as a reference to all who need to implement dynamic analysis on Android (or some aspects) and require an overview of available and usable solutions.

# 1 INTRODUCTION
Google-Play, the largest Apps-Store for Android, currently accommodates ∼3 million apps. Apps sometimes leak personal data or unintentionally contain vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities and privacy violations are mostly invisible to the users and can only be found by well-educated users and the use of additional tools. However, users should be informed about such undesired properties and possibly avoid those apps. Users should instead be able to choose apps without or with fewer privacy and security risks from the plenitude provided by the Apps-Store.

# 2 RELATED WORK
There already exist surveys and overview papers of app stimulation (UI automation) as well as behavior monitoring tools for Android app analysis. However, we realized during our research that these are often outdated and proposed tools are not maintained anymore and are thus not well usable. Other publications describe tools, but the implementation is unavailable, thus not usable.
A good read to start with App stimulation is . Choudary et al. and Sapienz are dated back to 2015/2016 and even though they offer a good introduction into the topic as well as an evaluation of automation tool effectiveness, the information is not up to date. Vasquez et al. deliver in 2017 a slightly more up to date overview paper. It gives a very comprehensive tool overview and mentions pros and cons of the different possible methods. Luo et al. deliver in 2020 an updated overview of app stimulation tools. However, their objective is more functionality test oriented than security and privacy oriented. They focus on the simulation of a realistic sensor environment for testing the app.

Lam et al. also provide an overview of UI automation tools, but only with the background of record and replay functionality. This provides the ability to record test sequences for known apps, but this concept doesn’t work in a fully automatic approach. Tramontana et al. provide in 2019 a systematic mapping study on automated functional testing. Due to the nature of such a study, it reveals hot research topics, current trends and popular papers in this area but lacks in giving recommendations on practically usable tools.
A good overview paper about app behavior monitoring is presented by Neuner et al. in 2019. Unfortunately, the paper is no more up to date and also mainly focuses on app sandboxing for malware analysis. In general, most papers in this area are focused on the needs of malware analysis which however is often not applicable for privacy or vulnerability analysis. A more comprehensive and up to date list of tools is provided on GithubWW.
In summary, we’ve found no overview paper or survey covering app stimulation (UI automation) as well as app behavior monitoring in the context of privacy and security. Thus, we want to propose an infrastructure model along with practically usable, up to date tools for large scale dynamic analysis environment for Android in this paper.

# 3 DYNAMIC ANALYSIS ENVIRONMENT DESIGN
This section proposes an abstract dynamic analysis environment design (Figure 1). The following sections describe the required components, their capabilities and the required communication. The central element in the design is the device or the emulator, with the different software abstraction layers. On the one hand, there is an App Stimulation component, which remotely controls the device. On the other hand there is a Behavior Monitor and a Network Monitor which observe the app’s interaction with device. A separation is desirable to simplify network traffic analysis. All performed actions and monitored device interaction are provided to the control logic. It primarily logs the execution details for later analysis after the dynamic analysis run.
# 3 App Stimulation
Basic interactions are tap, swipe or textual input. These interactions are handed to the OS kernel by privileged system apps and are usually triggered through interaction with the device hardware.
To get an idea of necessary interactions, we manually interacted with the top 20 apps on Google Play. Besides basic UI events, such as tap or swipe actions, also more complex actions are required. An important first step for many apps is to overcome the sign in process. This mostly requires either a classic username/email and password login or they "Signin with Google" for authentication through Google. Alternatively, mostly messaging apps require a phone number to send authentication codes to, which need to be transferred to the app (SMS/email Service in Figure 1). Some apps also demand personal information like address, name, age, birthday. These fields need to be recognized and filled with appropriate information. Content hints are often provided on these input fields by the app programmer, they need to be evaluated and matched against predefined values in the credentials/personal info database. This information might later on be subject due to privacy leaks.
Another topic of interest is the settings menu. Menu items sometimes let one choose the used encryption and reveal default settings. The privacy terms and usage terms are also often found in this menu and changes in these terms from version to version are of interest for the user. There also exist extended UI events such as pinch to zoom or other two finger actions. On the one hand, these multi-touch actions are quite diverse and are not (yet) covered through the ADB protocol. On the other hand, they are besides from games not very common and if used, are often also represented as separate buttons. Thus, such interaction seems necessary to find software crashes but is not required for the described goal due to the often redundant interaction possibilities.
Another category of events is system events, also called broadcast actions. This could for example be "new picture", where each app can sign up for to be notified when a new picture was taken. The signin for around 300 of such broadcasts was formerly required be stated in the AndroidManifest.xml of each app. Currently, apps can also dynamically signin for broadcasts during runtime. These broadcasts trigger methods which are usually never reachable during interaction via the app’s UI. For comprehensive dynamic app analysis, the different registered broadcasts should be triggered and the app’s behavior observed.

Since the intention is to build app stimulation, which repeatedly tests applications, it is desirable that the observed results and therewith the interaction sequence remains constant for the same app version. Additionally, a record and replay functionality would be useful to be able to also manually inspect analysis results (hinted as "Interaction Logger" in Figure 1).
# 3 App Behavior Monitor
We leveraged OWASP Mobile Top 10 (W) and the Appicaptor Security Index (W) to identify common vulnerabilities of apps. By far the most common security vulnerabilities are unprotected communication such as http instead of https access, faulty certificate validation in self implemented trust managers used in SSL/TLS communication or insecure encryption usage. For the aspect of privacy it is relevant to check the usage of data stored on the phone such as: contacts, messages, call history, . . . but also device properties such as: GPS location, connected WiFi/Bluetooth networks, . . . or installed apps. The usage of these properties needs to be tracked during behavior monitoring and in a second stage evaluated.
During UI stimulation, one needs measures to observe what the app actually does in the background. Therefor, different points of action exists. Like shown in Figure 1 the Android system has a layered architecture and in-between each layer there is the possibility to intercept the function calls. The higher the layer, the more abstract the function calls become. The highest layer is the Java API. For example the current GPS position can be requested via the API function locationManager.getLastKnownLocation(LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDER). Thus, intercepting this function would exhibit GPS usage and one could for example even read the GPS position and see if this location is sent over the network later on. The data identification can be accomplished since the provided data like address book entries or provided GPS location are set or known during the automated device interaction. Since data can internally be converted into other representations, like base64, hex and different hashing functions, the intercepted data would also need to be checked against these alternative representations.
The native libraries reside below the Java API. These libraries are compiled to the target CPU architecture and give a slightly abstracted interface to kernel functionalities as libraries. This also allows C/C++ app-libraries to run on Android through the Java Native Interface (JNI). However, using sensors through JNI takes a lot of boilerplate code to initialize the sensors compared to the Java interface and some sensors (GPS) are not covered through JNIW. In conclusion, intercepting native library calls is necessary to observe functionality of apps partly written in C/C++ but it can not replace Java API interception.
On the bottom layer is the hardware abstraction layer (HAL) and the kernel consuming so called system-calls. These system-calls handle for example threads, user rights management, file and file system interaction and sockets. Reading sensor data comes down to reading a specific file and configuring the sensor to write data to a file. Thus, calls to the Java API or native libraries are reflected in several system-calls. It is not possible to filter or log all system calls due to the immense call frequency. Thus, we don’t recommend intercepting system-calls or make it very selectively and carefully.
# 3 Network Monitor
Even though network traffic could also be observed through API calls in the operating system, it might not be the most convenient way. Using for example a proxy server as network monitor lets one easily observe called addresses, the content of the transmission and if the requests are protected. It is also fairly easy to check for the usage of faulty trust managers, since certificates can easily be exchanged. As described in Section 3, it is also necessary to decode data in different data formats.
# 3 Control Logic
The control logic is thought of as the central element controlling the others. The control logic should on the one hand trigger the app stimulation and on the other hand set up appropriate hooks in the API and Network Monitor to observe the behavior triggered by the app stimulation. At the end of the interaction, the different logged information about app stimulation and API calls have to be correlated and security vulnerabilities or privacy frauds detected.
# 4 APP STIMULATION TOOL EVALUATION
This section evaluates different features provided by app stimulation tools (Table 1). We explain the different options that are not self-explanatory and list pros and cons of each method. The column UI Events indicates if a tool is able to perform basic UI events such as tap and swipe actions. Context aware input indicates the capability to fill out login forms or address fields. System events are capabilities to trigger broadcast messages if a photo was taken or the device screen went on/off. The Instrumentation column tells how the UI interaction is executed. This can either be a modified operating system (OS), an instrumented test app or no instrumentation at all using build in functionality. Modified operating systems are powerful but time intensive to maintain. Modifications have to be at least yearly renewed for new Android versions. Instrumenting the application has the advantage, that activities can directly be triggered. A disadvantage is that this requires repacking the app, which is detectable by the app. Some tools do not require instrumentation and thus rely on Androids inbuilt ADB. The disadvantage of this method is that the feature set is limited. Different exploration strategies exist to interact with UI elements: Random (rnd), Model-based (model) and Systematic (sys). Random approaches randomly trigger UI interactions and usually fire them at high rates. It is common to define seed, to make interaction consistent and reproducible. The advantage of this approach is that it often achieves high UI exploration coverage, mainly due to the high event firing rate. A disadvantage is, that it gets stuck at login screens without further context awareness. High event firing rates often reveal app crashes, which is good for finding bugs, but undesirable for a security and privacy analysis. Model-based exploration often generates a finite-state-machine to model the different app activities as states and the event input combinations to move from one state to another. Advantage of this approach is that different activities can be explored more directly and the tool can easily come back to certain activities in the model to fully explore all available activities. A disadvantage is that it is rather slow, since dumping the UI elements and assigning states requires much computation . Thus, random approaches often achieve the same or higher UI coverage than

a model based approaches. Another challenge is to model states without a state explosion[21 , 41]. The last option is a systematic approach. This approach defines certain rules to interact with the UI. For example start clicking buttons from left to right or first fill in text fields before pressing buttons. This approach also allows login handling. The biggest disadvantage of this approach is that the systematic interaction rules have to be carefully designed reach all activities and not get stuck. To overcome this flaw, random exploration is often additionally used. In the context of vulnerability and privacy analysis, a systematic or model-based exploration strategy seems favorable to overcome the login and context aware inputs which are not provided by fully random approaches. A static app analysis can be used to get insights of the app to be explored. For example how many activities are defined and from which activities one can switch to other activities [ 6]. This item is rated neutral due to the additional effort and few advantages in UI exploration coverage [38 ]. The column Device Type indicates if the tool runs only on a real hardware (dev) or just uses an emulator (emu) or runs on both. A tool supporting devices and emulators is preferable, since both have their advantages. Emulators scale very well in parallel on powerful servers. However, some apps refuse to run in emulators. Real devices are more costly and harder to maintain but are capable to run all apps. Thus, a mix of emulators and some devices seems perfect. To test apps, there are different test type methods: white-, gray- and black-box tests. Since the intention is to analyze stranger apps without source-code, only gray and black-box tests are feasible. The last feature is the ability to record and replay a test. This is a very important feature, as a detailed privacy finding. According to a survey of [ 45 ] in 2018, the most relevant publications are Dynodroid[ 30 ], A3E[ 6 ], Sapienz[ 32 ] and AndroidRipper[ 4]. Dynodroid lacks a license and seems to be not maintained since 2017. A3E is not maintained since 2016 and lacks generation of system events. Sapienz contains all desired features but is also not maintained since 2017. Android ripper lacks in generation of system events, a record and replay functionality and is also unmaintained since 2017. More recent tools with updates in 2019 to 2021 are: app-check, DroidMate, Google RoboTest, Monkey, REAPER and Stoat. DroidMate lacks in the generation of system events and additionally, DroidMate is unable to handle contextual input. Google RoboTest is an online service for dynamic app testing. Thus, it is good for finding bugs, but one can’t perform custom tests. The Monkey tool lacks in contextual input generation and would get stuck at every login screen. REAPER lacks in system event generation and record and replay functionality. Stoat only supports white-box testing which is unusable for testing closed-source apps.
# 4 App Stimulation Framework Evaluation
App stimulation frameworks are presented in the second part of Table 1. The property explanations match the ones in the previous section. Currently, only Appium, Quantum and Qmetry support the desired feature of generating system event, even though some events are only supported in the emulator. Quantum is a proprietary tool, only supporting white box tests and no record and replay. Qmetry integrates Appium, Selenuim/Webdriver and Quantum. Thus, it is rather a common interface for test automation. The focus of the framework lies on a test-driven development rather than generic app interaction, which shifts Qmetry out of the focus.

# NETWORK MONITOR
For monitoring the network, features such as http(s) packet content inspection, SSL/TLS certificate exchange and packet modification are required. An API to control and export logs would be essential to properly interface the Network Monitor from the Control Logic.
There exist plenty of network inspection tools like the well known Wireshark. However, these tools tackle a too low inspection level. CharlesW and HTTP ToolkitW are easy-to-use proxies with a nice UI, but lack an external API, which makes it hard to control in an automated environment. FiddlerW is a closed-source tool with an almost two decade long history and provides a plenitude of features. However, it lacks an external control API and automation can only be achieved through JScript.NET extensions/scripts, a mix of .NET and JavaScript. ZAproxyW and Burp SuiteW is a proxy mainly designed for website security testing. ZAproxy offers a great API interaction interface for a variety of languages. However, both tools focus on web page pentests and omit required features such as packet and certificate modification. mitmproxyW is a well maintained open-source tool that offers a python API interface for external control and supports all required features. As a result, mitmproxy can be recommended as network monitor tool.
# CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we proposed an abstract design for dynamic Android app vulnerability and privacy analysis and discussed the necessary components of such an infrastructure. An extensive overview of available tools for each component is given and relevant tool properties are displayed in tables for easy comparison, updating outdated related overview papers. Different tools in each category are evaluated based on these aspects and promising ones are promoted. For app stimulation we recommended Appium and app-check, for behavior monitoring a suggestion to Objection and Frida is given in combination with mitmproxy as network monitor. To not share the fate of past overview papers, we propose continuously updated Github tables for everyone to edit. In summary, the available tools today are mostly not usable as plug-and-play. Much implementation effort is still required to achieve a dynamic app analysis environment. As future work, we intend to fill this gap and provide a plug-and-play solution in the context of dynamic Android app analysis. With this publication, we hope to give developers having the goal to generate a dynamic analysis environment a good introduction to the topic as well as a list of available tools at hand.
