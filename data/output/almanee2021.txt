# Abstract
Android apps include third-party native libraries to increase performance and to reuse functionality. Native code is directly executed from apps through the Java Native Interface or the Android Native Development Kit. Android developers add precompiled native libraries to their projects, enabling their use. Unfortunately, developers often struggle or simply neglect to update these libraries in a timely manner. This results in the continuous use of outdated native libraries with unpatched security vulnerabilities years after patches became available.
To further understand such phenomena, we study the security updates in native libraries in the most popular 200 free apps on Google Play from Sept. 2013 to May 2020. A core difficulty we face in this study is the identification of libraries and their versions. Developers often rename or modify libraries, making their identification challenging. We create an approach called LibRARIAN (LibRAry veRsion IdentificAtioN) that accurately identifies native libraries and their versions as found in Android apps based on our novel similarity metric bin2sim. LibRARIAN leverages different features extracted from libraries based on their metadata and identifying strings in read-only sections.
We discovered 53/200 popular apps (26%) with vulnerable versions with known CVEs between Sept. 2013 and May 2020, with 14 of those apps remaining vulnerable. We find that app developers took, on average, 528 ± 40 days to apply security patches, while library developers release a security patch after 54 ± 8 days—a 10 times slower rate of update.
# I. Introduction
Third-party libraries are convenient, reusable, and form an integral part of mobile apps. Developers can save time and effort by reusing already implemented functionality. Native third-party libraries are prevalent in Android applications (“apps”), especially social networking and gaming apps. These two app categories—ranked among the top categories on Google Play—require special functionality such as 3D rendering, or audio/video encoding/decoding , , , , . These tasks tend to be resource-intensive and are, thus, often handled by native libraries to improve runtime performance.
The ubiquity of third-party libraries in Android apps increases the attack surface ,  since host apps expose vulnerabilities propagated from these libraries , . Another series of previous work has studied the outdatedness and updateability of third-party Java libraries in Android apps , , with a focus on managed code of such apps (e.g., Java or Dalvik code). However, these previous studies do not consider native libraries used by Android apps.
We argue that security implications in native libraries are even more critical for three main reasons. First, app developers add native libraries but neglect to update them. The reasons for this may include concerns over regressions arising from such updates, prioritizing new functionality over security, deadline pressures, or lack of tracking library dependencies and their security patches. This negligence results in outdated or vulnerable native libraries remaining in new versions of apps. Second, native libraries are susceptible to memory vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflow attacks) that are straightforward to exploit. Third, and contrary to studies from almost 10 years ago , , native libraries are now used pervasively in mobile apps. To illustrate this point, we analyzed the top 200 apps from Google Play between Sept. 2013 and May 2020. We obtained the version histories of these apps from AndroZoo  totaling 7,678 versions of those 200 top free apps. From these apps, we identified 66,684 native libraries in total with an average of 11 libraries per app and a maximum of 141 for one version of Instagram.
To better understand the usage of third-party native libraries in Android apps and its security implications, we conduct a longitudinal study to identify vulnerabilities in third-party native libraries and assess the extent to which developers update such libraries of their apps. In order to achieve this, we make the following research contributions:
- We construct a novel approach, called LibRARIAN (LibRAry veRsion IdentificAtioN) that, given an unknown binary, identifies (i) the library it implements and (ii) its version. Furthermore, we introduce a new similarity-scoring mechanism for comparing native binaries called bin2sim, which utilizes 6 features that enable LibRARIAN to distinguish between different libraries and their versions. The features cover both metadata and data extracted from the libraries. These features represent elements of a library that are likely to change between major, minor, and patch versions of a native library.
- We conduct a large-scale, longitudinal study that tracks security vulnerabilities in native libraries used in apps over 7 years. We build a repository of Android apps and their native libraries with the 200 most popular free apps from Google Play totaling 7,678 versions gathered between the dates of Sept. 2013 and May 2020. This repository further contains 66,684 native libraries used by these 7,678 versions.
between binaries. However, these approaches identify semantic similarities/differences between binaries at the function-level, with the goal of identifying malware. LibRARIAN, orthogonally, is a syntactic-based tool which computes similarity between two benign binaries (at the file-level) with the goal of identifying library versions with high scalability.
We utilize LibRARIAN and our repository to study (1) LibRARIAN’s accuracy and effectiveness, (2) the prevalence of vulnerabilities in native libraries in the top 200 apps, and (3) the rate at which app developers apply patches to address vulnerabilities in native binaries. The major findings of our study are as follows:
- For our ground truth dataset which contains 46 known libraries with 904 versions, LibRARIAN correctly identifies 91% of those library versions, thus achieving a high identification accuracy.
- To study the prevalence of vulnerabilities in the top 200 apps in Google Play, we use LibRARIAN to examine 53 apps with vulnerable versions and known CVEs between Sept. 2013 and May 2020. 14 of these apps remain vulnerable and contain a wide-range of vulnerability types— including denial of service, memory leaks, null pointer dereferences, or divide-by-zero errors. We further find that libraries in these apps, on average, have been outdated for 859 ± 137 days. The combination of high severity and long exposure of these vulnerabilities results in ample opportunity for attackers to target these highly popular apps.
- To determine developer response rate of applying security fixes, we utilize LibRARIAN to analyze 40 apps, focusing on popular third-party libraries (those found in more apps) with known CVEs such as FFmpeg, GIFLib, OpenSSL, WebP, SQLite3, OpenCV, Jpeg-turbo, Libpng, and XML2, between Sept. 2013 and May 2020. We find that app developers took, on average, 528±40 days to apply security patches, while library developers release a security patch after 54 ± 8 days— a 10 times slower rate of update. These libraries that tend to go for long periods without being patched affect highly popular apps with billions of downloads and installs.
- We make our dataset, analysis platform, and results available online to enable reusability, reproducibility, and others to build upon our work .
# II. LibRARIAN
Unknown Lib Versions

Known Lib Versions
# A. Feature Vector Extraction
Our binary similarity detection is based on the extraction of features from binaries combining both metadata found in Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) files as well as identifying features in different binary sections of the library. All shared libraries included in Android apps are compiled into ELF binaries. Like other object files, ELF binaries contain a symbol table with externally visible identifiers such as function names, global symbols, local symbols, and imported symbols. This symbol table is used (1) during loading and linking and (2) by binary analysis tools  (e.g., objdump, readelf, nm, pwntools, or angr ) to infer information about the binary.
To distinguish between different libraries and their versions, we need to identify differencing features. To that end, we define a set of six features inherent to versions and libraries. Five features represent ELF metadata, these features are used to compute the similarity score between two binaries as described in Section II-B, hence, we refer to these features as Metadata Features. Orthogonally, we leverage strings extracted from the .rodata section of an ELF object, which we refer to as Version Identification Strings. This feature complements the similarity score from the first set of features. We either use it to verify the correctness of the version or as a fallback if the similarity to existing binaries in our ground-truth dataset is low (see Section II-C).
Table I shows the list of all LibRARIAN features. The features include: (i) five Metadata Features based on exported and imported functions, exported and imported globals, and library dependencies; and (ii) one Data Feature which is applied as a second factor to either substitute the Metadata Features, in case the reported similarity score is low, or to confirm the reported score. These 6 features represent the code elements of a library that would be expected to change based on a versioning scheme that distinguishes major, minor, and patch versions of a library. Furthermore, these features are stable across platforms regardless of the underlying architecture or compilation environments. We did not include code features (e.g., control-flow and data-flow features) as they are extremely volatile and change between compilations and across architectures. Binary similarity matching is a hard open

problem: While recent work has made progress regarding accuracy , , , , , , , , the majority of algorithms have exponential computation cost relative to the code size and are infeasible for large-scale studies. We built a dataset of heuristics by inspecting the binaries in our ground-truth dataset. We developed scripts to process the data in the .rodata sections extracted during feature processing and search for unique per-library strings that contain version information. For example, FFmpeg version info is found when applying the regex f f m p e g - ( [ 0 - 9 ] \ . ) * [ 0 - 9 ] or FFmpeg version ( [ 0 - 9 ] \ . ) * [ 0- 9]. Table II shows our list of extracted version heuristics. Each version heuristic can be produced automatically by constructing regular expressions from strings in .rodata sections of binaries in our ground-truth dataset. For example, if the string “libFoo-1” is found in version 1 of libFoo, LibRARIAN uses a regular expression replacing the numeric suffix of the string with an appropriate pattern (e.g., l i b F o o - [ 0 - 9 ] + ( \ . [ 0 - 9 ] ) * ).
The similarity score is a real number between 0 and 1, with a score of 1 indicating identical features, a score of 0 indicating no shared features between the two libraries, and a fractional value indicating a partial match. Due to the volatility of the similarity score, filtering noise such as platform-specific details as mentioned in the previous section is essential for the accuracy of our approach.
LibRARIAN counts an unknown library instance from Unknown Lib Versions as matching a known library version if its bin2sim is above 0. This threshold was determined experimentally and works effectively as our evaluation will demonstrate (see Section III). If bin2sim results in the same value above the threshold for multiple known binaries, LibRARIAN tries obtaining an exact match between one of the known binaries and the unknown binary by using their hash codes to determine the unknown binary’s version.
A low similarity score might result from modifications made by app developers to the original third-party library which results in the removal or addition of specific features. From our experience, removal of features from the original library is common among mobile developers and is likely driven by the need to reduce the size of the library and the app as much as possible. For example, we observed that the WebP video codec library is often deployed without encoding functionalities to reduce binary size. Some size optimization techniques require choosing needed modules from a library and leaving the rest, stripping the resulting binary, and modifying build flags. Another factor that reduces similarity as measured by the Jaccard coefficient is that certain architectures tend to export more features as compared to others. For instance, 32-bit architectures such as armeabi-v7a and x86 export more features compared to arm64-v8a and x86_64.
# B. Similarity Computation
LibRARIAN’s similarity computation, which we refer to as bin2sim, leverages the five Metadata Features when computing the similarity scores between an app binary and our.
# C. Version Identification Strings
For libraries where LibRARIAN reports low similarity scores (e.g., some libraries like RenderScript or Unity only...
# TABLE II: Heuristics used to search for unique per-library strings that contain version information
export a single function 1), these five features fail to provide sufficient information about the underlying components in a library. If libraries only export one or a few functions, the similarity metrics have a hard time distinguishing between different libraries. We therefore extend the features with strings that uniquely identify the library. Such strings are often version strings. Based on extracted flexible per-library heuristics from our ground-truth dataset (see Table II), we heuristically identify exact library versions and increase overall accuracy. For libraries with high similarity scores, we use these library heuristics to confirm the correct version.
To identify binaries with low similarity scores, we leverage Version Identification Strings, which is the set of extracted per-library version strings. For example, say a library version extracted from app a had a similarity score of 0 when compared with OpenCV-2 using Metadata Features. Given the low score, we search the Version Identification Strings feature for specific keywords such as General configuration for OpenCV *.*.* or opencv-* .*.*. Where the asterisk represents the versioning scheme of OpenCV library.
Our feature extraction process logs all strings (arrays of more than 3 ASCII printable characters ending with a 0 byte) from the .rodata section alongside the other features. As libraries commonly have large amounts of read-only string data that frequently changes, we cannot use this data directly as a feature (due to the low overlap resulting in low similarity). By processing the .rodata from our ground-truth dataset and clustering the data, we extract common version identifiers and version strings. We then translate them into regular expressions that allow us to match versions for different libraries.
# III. Evaluation
To assess the prevalence of vulnerable native libraries for Android, we answer the following three research questions:
RQ1: Accuracy and effectiveness of LibRARIAN. Can LibRARIAN accurately and effectively identify versions of native libraries? How does LibRARIAN compare against state-of-the-art native-library version identification? How effective are LibRARIAN’s feature types at identifying versions of native libraries?
RQ2: Prevalence of outdated libraries. How prevalent are vulnerabilities in native libraries of Android apps?
RQ3: Patch response time. After a vulnerability is reported for a third-party library, how quickly do developers apply patches?
To supplement the aforementioned RQs, we conducted a detailed case study on a vulnerable app (Section III-D), providing practical insight into vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and possible exploits.
To answer these research questions, we analyze the top 200 apps in Google Play over several years. We track the version history of these apps from AndroZoo , a large repository of over 11 million Android apps. Our repository contains app metadata including the app name, release dates, and native binaries. Note that Google Play unfortunately restricts lists to 200 apps. Overall, we collected 7,678 instances, where each instance is a version of the 200 top apps from Google Play.
We determined that 145 out of 200 (72%) of the distinct apps in our repository contain at least one native library, i.e., 5,852 out of 7,678 (76%) of the total apps in our database. There are a total of 66,684 libraries in the form of .so files, i.e., shared library files, in our repository with an average of 11 libraries per app and a maximum of 141 for one version of Instagram. In fact, Instagram—for which we collected 184 versions since Dec. 2013—contains a total of 6,677 .so files.
We run LibRARIAN on a machine with 2 AMD EPYC 7551 32-Core CPUs and 512GB of RAM running Ubuntu 18. The average number of features in the extracted feature vectors is 2,116 features. Some outliers such as libWaze and libTensorflow reach up to 79,581 features. This shows that the set of third-party native libraries in our repository is diverse, some of them are very complex and offer a large number of functionalities. Generating feature vectors is quick and generally takes a few seconds per library. The most complex library, libTensorflow takes 4 min and 38 sec to analyze. We found that, out of 7,253 binaries for which LibRARIAN inferred their versions, the average runtime for library version detection is 118 seconds—with a minimum of 97 seconds and a maximum of 224 seconds.
# RQ1: Accuracy and Effectiveness
# Finding 1: LibRARIAN achieves a 12% improvement in its accuracy compared to OSSPolice on the 67 unique binaries in OSSPolice’s dataset.
LibRARIAN identifies native library versions from Android apps. We assess LibRARIAN in three scenarios. For the first scenario, we compare its accuracy with OSSPolice, the state-of-the-art technique for identifying versions of native binaries for Android apps. For the second scenario, we assess LibRARIAN's accuracy on a larger and more recent set of library versions than those found in OSSPolice's dataset. To that end, we manually collect a set of binaries with known libraries and versions (Known Versions in Figure 1). In the third scenario, we assess the effectiveness of LibRARIAN’s feature types at identifying versions of native libraries.
# 1) Comparative Analysis:
OSSPolice uses source code to build an index that allows it to identify versions of binaries. OSSPolice measures the similarity between strings extracted from binaries and features found directly in source repositories. Unlike LibRARIAN, OSSPolice relies on comparing binaries with source code, resulting in an overly large feature space which, in turn, makes OSSPolice susceptible to falsely identifying any binary containing a library as exactly matching that library. For example, OSSPolice falsely identifies MuPDF and OpenCV as matching Libpng because those two libraries include Libpng in their source code .
# Experiment Setup:
We first manually locate the pre-built binaries of libraries to serve as ground truth. To that end, we use readily available auxiliary data such as keywords found in feature vectors, binary filenames, and dependencies. Once we identify potential targets, we retrieve the pre-built binaries of all versions and architectures, if possible. There are a variety of distribution channels where app developers can obtain third-party binaries. We obtained such binaries from official websites, GitHub, and Debian repositories. The binaries with known libraries and versions contain 46 distinct libraries with a total of 904 versions and an average of 19 versions per library.
# Results:
LibRARIAN correctly identified the versions of 824/904 (91%) libraries in our ground truth: 553/904 (61%) of these library versions have unique feature vectors; 15% of these libraries contain the exact version number in the strings literals; and the remaining 14% of library versions are distinguished using hash codes to break ties between binaries. Misidentification occurs in 8% of library versions, where the largest equivalence class contains 4 library versions. This usually occurs for consecutive versions—minor or micro revisions (e.g., 3 and 3). These minor or micro revisions generally fix small bugs and do not change, add, or remove exported functions, global variables, and dependencies that uniquely identify different versions of binaries. Although LibRARIAN cannot pinpoint the exact library version in this case, it significantly reduces the search space for post-analysis to a few candidate versions.
# Finding 2:
LibRARIAN correctly identifies 824 of 904 (91%) library versions from 46 distinct libraries, making it highly accurate for identifying the native libraries and versions. For misidentified library versions, LibRARIAN reports a slightly different version. Nevertheless, LibRARIAN significantly reduces the number of binaries that need to be manually inspected.
# 3) Feature Effectiveness:
To assess the effectiveness of Metadata Features, Version Identification Strings, and their combination at inferring binaries, we computed the extent to which each feature is capable of inferring binaries in our repository. To that end, any binary whose library and version can be inferred with a bin score above 0, as described, is considered effective.
# Metadata
in Section II counts as an inferred binary. We found that 37% of binaries in our repository are inferable by Version Identification Strings only. 45% of the remaining binaries are inferable using only the five Metadata Features mentioned in Section II-A, while the remaining 17% are inferred using both Metadata Features and Version Identification Strings. This indicates that not all libraries have the version information encoded directly in the strings. Having a combination of both Metadata Features and Version Identification Strings is crucial to increase the number of inferred binaries.
# Experiment Setup
We infer the correct version of 7,253 binaries (10% of the total binaries in our Android repository) using LibRARIAN. Due to the highly time-consuming nature of the manual collection of ground-truth binaries, we limit ourselves to libraries that (i) are found in a greater number of apps (more than 10 apps) and (ii) have known CVEs. As a result, an overwhelming majority of the remaining binaries in our dataset have either no known CVEs or affect very few apps, making them an unsuitable choice for applying an expensive manual analysis for studying this research question.
# Results
We found that, out of 7,253 binaries for which we inferred their versions, 3,674 were vulnerable libraries (50%) affecting 53/200 distinct apps. 14 new releases of these distinct apps remain vulnerable at the time of submission. The complete list of libraries with reported CVEs between Sept. 2013 and the writing of this paper can be found in Table IV. As for the number of apps affected by vulnerable libraries, our results show that 53 distinct apps have been affected by a minimum of 1 vulnerable library and a maximum of 16 vulnerable libraries covering dates between Sept 2013 and May 2020.
# Finding 4
53 of the 200 top apps on Google Play (26%) were plagued by a vulnerable library over approximately six years and 8 months (i.e., between Sept. 2013 and May 2020). 14 of those apps still include a vulnerable binary, i.e., 7% of the top 200 apps on Google Play, even at the time at which we collected apps for this study and are, on average, outdated by 859 ± 137 days. As a result, vulnerable native libraries play a substantial role in exposing popular Android apps to known vulnerabilities.
# Finding 3
37% of binaries are inferable using Version Identification Strings, 45% are inferable using Metadata Features, and 17% are inferable using both feature types. Exported Functions and Imported Functions account for the overwhelming majority of effectiveness of Metadata Features, contributing 58% and 32%, respectively.

# B. RQ2: Prevalence of Vulnerable Libraries
To study the prevalence of vulnerabilities in native libraries, we need to identify their exact versions. To that end, we need to identify their exact versions. Four libraries were particularly prevalent in terms of the number of vulnerable versions they contain (i.e., OpenSSL), the number of apps they affect (i.e., OpenCV and GIFLib), or the length of time during which the library remained vulnerable (i.e., XML2 in Microsoft XBox SmartGlass). OpenSSL has the largest number of vulnerable versions (22 in total) included in 13 distinct apps. 3 apps: Amazon Alexa, Facebook Messenger and Norton Secure VPN still include vulnerable.
# TABLE IV: A list of libraries with reported CVEs found in our repository along with the number of distinct apps that were affected by a vulnerable library and the number of distinct apps containing a vulnerable version till now.
OpenCV and GIFLib affect the most apps. OpenCV has the largest number of affected apps with a total of 21 apps where 7 recent apps still have a vulnerable instance of OpenCV. Most applications do not include OpenCV directly but indirectly through the dependencies of card.io which enables card payment processing but comes with the two outdated versions (2 and 2) of both opencv_core and opencv_imgproc. Following OpenCV in the number of affected apps is GIFLib, which has two vulnerable versions found in a total of 15 distinct apps, 1 app is still affected.
One vulnerable version of XML2 (2) was found in 35 versions of Microsoft XBox SmartGlass and the library was not updated for 6 years—still remaining vulnerable up to the writing of this paper. This particular case is notable due to the extremely long amount of time the library had been vulnerable and remained vulnerable.
To examine the affects of vulnerable libraries on apps further, we list popular apps and the reported CVEs they expose their users to. Table V shows 10 out of 14 popular apps that are using at least one library with a reported CVE at the time of our app collection. We discuss four of these apps in more detail in the remainder of this section.
Facebook Messenger, which has a download base of over 500M (the largest in this list), contains OpenSSL-1, which is vulnerable since Sept. 2016. This vulnerable library contains multiple memory leaks which allows an attacker to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by sending large OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) request extensions.
Amazon Kindle, an app that provides access to an electronic library of books—with a total of more than 100M installs, uses two vulnerable libraries: XML2-2 and Libpng-1. XML2-2 contains a variant of the “billion laughs” vulnerability which allows attackers to craft an XML document with a large number of nested entries that results in a denial of service attack. XML2-2 is vulnerable since Nov. 2014 and continues to be used in recent versions of the app. Libpng-1 has a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability. This vulnerability was published 6 years ago under CVE-2013-6954 and it remains unchanged in recent releases of Amazon Kindle.
DoorDash, a food delivery app with more than 10M installs includes GIFLib-5 which was reported vulnerable over 8 months ago. A malformed GIF file triggers a division-by-zero exception in the DGifSlurp function in GIFLib versions prior to 5. This vulnerable library remains unchanged up to now.
Target uses OpenCV-2 as a dependency of card.io which enables card payment processing. This version of OpenCV was announced vulnerable in Aug. 2017 yet remains unchanged in these apps.
# TABLE V: 10 out of 14 popular apps from Google Play which include a vulnerable library that remained unchanged.
Finding 5: These four apps showcase that these vulnerabilities are wide-ranging involving denial of service, memory leaks, or null pointer dereferences. The high severity and long exposure time of these vulnerabilities results in ample opportunity for attackers to target these highly popular apps.
# C. RQ3: Rate of Vulnerable Library Fixing
To determine the vulnerability response rate, we identify the duration between (1) the release time of a security update and (2) the time at which app developers applied a fix either by (i) updating to a new library version or (ii) completely removing a vulnerable library. Recall that we collected the previous
versions of the top 200 apps from Google Play. Moreover, we inferred the library versions from 7,253 libraries using LibRARIAN. Given the histories of apps and inferred library versions we can track the library life span per app—i.e., the time at which a library is added to an app and when it is either removed or updated to a new version in the app.
To this end, we analyzed 40 popular apps with known vulnerable versions of FFmpeg, GIFLib, OpenSSL, WebP, SQLite3, OpenCV, Jpeg-turbo, Libpng, and XML2, between Sept. 2013 and May 2020. We exclude apps that removed a library before a CVE was associated with it and apps containing libraries that are vulnerable up to the writing of this paper. We obtained the date at which a library vulnerability was found; when a security patch was made available for the library; and the time at which either the library was updated to a new version or removed. Table VI shows all the combinations of apps and vulnerable libraries.
# Finding 6:
On average, library developers release a security patch after 54 ± 8 days from a reported CVE. App developers apply these patches, on average, after 528 ± 40 days from the date an update was made available—which is about 10 times slower than the rate at which library developers release security patches.
Finding 6 reveals that many popular Android apps expose end-users to long vulnerability periods, especially considering that library developers released fixed versions much sooner. This extreme lag between release of a security patch for a library and the time at which an app developer updates to the patched libraries, or just eliminates the library, indicates that, at best, it is (1) highly challenging for developers to update these kinds of libraries or, less charitably, (2) app developers are highly negligent of such libraries.
TABLE VI: Combinations of 15 apps and particular vulnerable library versions they have contained, the date the vulnerability was publicly disclosed (Vul announced), the period between vulnerability disclosure and patch availability in days (i.e. Time-to-Release-Patch (TTRP)), and the total number of days elapsed before a fix was made (i.e. Time-to-Apply-Fix (TTAF)).
Developers applied security patches for vulnerable libraries at a rate as slow as 5 years, in the case of Xbox, and as fast as 267 days for Instagram, where a vulnerable version of FFmpeg was removed in that amount of time. In order to determine what type of fix was applied by a developer, we checked the next app version where a vulnerable library was last seen. We found that developers either kept the library but updated to a new version, removed a vulnerable version, or removed all native libraries in an app. In the next paragraphs, we discuss five popular native libraries used in Android apps that exhibit particularly slow fix rates: FFmpeg, OpenSSL, GIFLib, OpenCV, and SQLite3.
Multiple vulnerabilities were found in versions 2 and 3 of FFmpeg in Dec. 2016 and Jan. 2017, respectively. The number of days a security patch was released for these vulnerable library versions is 4 and 2 days, respectively. However, developers took 267 days to address vulnerabilities in Instagram, and nearly 3 years to apply a fix in Starmaker.
OpenSSL-1a and OpenSSL-1s were associated with CVE-2010-2939 and CVE-2016-2105 in Aug. 2010, and May 2016 of which OpenSSL developers provided a security patch 91 and 12 days after. However, developers of Zoom took 1,323 days to apply a fix, while developers of Amazon Alexa took 1,086 days.
A heap-based buffer overflow was reported in GIFLib-5 at the end of 2015. The results show that 3 apps using this vulnerable version of GIFLib have an average time-to-fix, i.e., total number of days elapsed before a fix was applied, of 850 days (2 years), which is 10 times slower. This lag time is particularly concerning since GIFLib released a fix 87 days after the vulnerable version.
A fix to an out-of-bounds read error that was affecting OpenCV through version 3 was released 41 days after the CVE was published. The vulnerable versions of this library affects 3 apps in total: Uber, Lyft, and eBay. OpenCV has an average time-to-fix of 799 days (i.e., 2 years), which is 19 times slower than the rate at which library developers of OpenCV release security patches.
SQLite3 released version 3, which fixes an integer overflow found in all versions prior to 3. Snapchat and Fitbit removed a vulnerable version of SQLite-3 library 786 days later.
# Finding 7:
The results for these five popular native libraries in Android apps show that it often takes years for app developers to update to new library versions—even if the existing version contains severe security or privacy vulnerabilities—placing millions of users at major risk.
To further understand the consequences of outdated vulnerable libraries, we calculated the average time-to-fix across all vulnerable libraries per app. Table VII lists the top 10 apps with the most number of days a vulnerable library remained in an app until a fix for the vulnerability was applied. Apple Music had the longest lag between the vulnerable library being introduced and fixed, i.e., 4 years. Uber was the fastest.
# TABLE VII:
# Top 10 most negligent apps in terms of the average time to fix a vulnerable library
at almost 589 days. Individual apps had as few as over 10 million installs and as many as over a billion installs. Among the social-media apps, Snapchat, which has over 1 billion downloads and the largest number of installs among the top 10 apps in Table VII, fixed its vulnerable libraries after 844 days. These very long times to fix vulnerable libraries in highly popular social-media apps places billions of users at high security risk.
# Finding 8:
The most neglected apps in terms of time to fix vulnerable native libraries range from 588 days to nearly five years, affecting billions of users and leaving them at substantial risk of having those libraries exploited. This finding emphasizes the need for future research to provide developers with mechanisms for speeding up this very slow fix rate.
# TABLE VIII:
# Top 10 most neglected vulnerable libraries in terms of the average time-to-fix
Finding 9: Future research should focus on these highly neglected libraries as experimental subjects for determining methods to ease the burden of updating these libraries; running regression tests to ensure these updates do not introduce new errors; and repairing those errors, possibly automatically, when they do arise.
# D. Exploitability Case Study
To demonstrate the exploitability of unpatched vulnerabilities in third party apps, we carry out a targeted case study where we analyze individual applications and create a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit. Our PoC highlights how these unpatched vulnerabilities can be exploited by third parties when interacting with the apps.
XRecoder allows users to capture screen videos, screen shots, and record video calls. Furthermore, XRecoder provides video editing functionalities, enabling users to trim videos and change their speed. This application uses FFmpeg, an open-source video encoding framework that provides video and audio editing, format transcoding, video scaling and post-production effects.
XRecoder embeds the FFmpeg library version 3, which is vulnerable to CVE-2018-14394 (reported in July 2018). FFmpeg-3 contains a vulnerable function (ff_mov_write_packet) that may result in a division-by-zero error if provided with an empty input packet. Hence, an attacker can craft a WaveForm audio to cause denial of service.
To assess whether this vulnerable function is reachable in XRecoder, we used Radare2 to replace the first instruction in the vulnerable function with an interrupt instruction. We run the application after the latter modification which consequently resulted in an app crash, i.e., allowing us to trigger the vulnerability consistently.
ff_mov_write_packet is called by multiple functions across two different binaries (FFmpeg-3.so and the app-specific libisvideo.so) and two different platforms (Dalvik and Native). av_buffersink_get_frame, one of the ancestors of ff_mov_write_packet, is called by nativeGenerateWaveFormData from the Dalvik-side.
# IV. Discussion:
Findings in RQ2 (Section III-B) demonstrate that out of 7,253 binaries for which we inferred their versions, 3,674 were vulnerable libraries (50%) affecting 53 distinct apps between Sept. 2013 and May 2020. This constitutes about 26% of the top 200 apps on Google Play. More alarmingly, new releases of 14 distinct apps remain vulnerable even at the time at which we collected apps for this study with an average outdatedness of 859 ± 137 days. While we have informed app developers about the outdated libraries in their apps, one interesting piece of follow-up work based on this result is surveying Android app developers to determine the reason for this extremely slow rate of fixing vulnerable native libraries in their apps. Such a study can further assess what forms of support app developers would need to truly reduce this slow rate of updating vulnerable library versions to ones with security patches.
For RQ3 (Section III-C), we analyzed the speed at which developers updated their apps to patched libraries and found
that, on average, library developers release a security patch frequency of vulnerable apps. Furthermore, we verified that after 54 ± 8 days from a reported CVE. While app developers apply these patches on average after 528 ± 41 days from the date an update was made available (10 times slower). Recall that we only consider apps in these cases that actually ended up fixing vulnerable native libraries. The results for RQ2 and RQ3 corroborate the need to make app developers aware of the severe risks they are exposing their users to by utilizing vulnerable native libraries.
Overall, our results demonstrate the degree to which native libraries are neglected in terms of leaving them vulnerable. Unfortunately, our findings indicate that the degree of negligence of native libraries is severe, while popular apps on Google Play use native libraries extensively with 145 out of 200 top free apps (72%). Interesting future work for our study includes uncovering the root causes of such negligence and means of aiding developers to quickly update their native libraries.
For example, platform providers (e.g., Google) could provide mechanisms to automatically update native libraries while also testing for regressions and possibly automatically repairing them. Such an idea is similar to how Debian’s repositories centrally manage libraries and dependencies between applications. Whenever a library is updated, only the patched library is updated, the applications remain the same. The Android system would highly profit from a similar approach of central dependency and vulnerability management.
Another threat to validity is the possibility of developers manually patching security vulnerabilities. To mitigate this threat, we checked the versions identified by LibRARIAN and found that LibRARIAN correctly identifies an overwhelming majority of patch-level versions (61%). For the patch-level versions that LibRARIAN cannot distinguish as effectively, LibRARIAN makes manual identification much easier, by significantly reducing the search space for post-analysis to only 3-4 candidate versions.
Furthermore, based on the results of our dataset, we believe that app developers are unlikely to manually patch a library they do not maintain given that it already takes years for these developers to simply update a library version.
The results from RQ1 show that LibRARIAN detects versions of native libraries with high accuracy (91%). The need to compare against binaries with a known number of versions and libraries (i.e., Known Lib Versions in Figure 1) limits LibRARIAN. Specifically, misidentification of a library or its version might occur when an unknown binary for which we are trying to identify a library and version does not exist in Known Lib Versions.
In these cases, LibRARIAN identifies the unknown binary as being the library and version closest to it according to bin sim that exists in Known Lib Versions. One possible way of enhancing LibRARIAN in such cases is to leverage supervised machine learning, which may, at least, be able to identify if the library is most likely an unknown major, minor, or patch version of a known library.
Internal validity. One internal threat is the accuracy of timestamps in AndroZoo and its effect on the reported patch life cycle findings. To mitigate this threat, we collected AndroZoo timestamps over three months and correlated updates with Google Play. We verified that AndroZoo has a maximum lag of 9 days. This short delay is much smaller than the update.
None of these studies examined native third-party libraries in Android apps nor did they look at the security impact of vulnerable libraries or whether these vulnerabilities are on the attack surface. LibRARIAN now explores the attack surface of vulnerable libraries.
# CONCLUSION
Third-party libraries have become ubiquitous among popular apps in the official Android market, Google Play, with 145 out of the 200 top free apps on Google Play (72%) containing native libraries. These libraries are particularly beneficial for handling CPU-intensive tasks and for reusing existing code in general. Unfortunately, the pervasiveness of native third-party libraries in Android apps exposes end users to a large set of unpatched security vulnerabilities.
To determine the extent to which these native libraries remain vulnerable in Android apps, we study the prevalence of native libraries in the top 200 apps on Google Play across 7,253 versions of those apps. From these versions, we extracted 66,684 native libraries. To identify versions of libraries, we constructed an approach called LibRARIAN that leverages a novel similarity metric, bin2sim, that is capable of identifying versions of native libraries with a high accuracy—a 91% correct identification rate.
For vulnerabilities, we found 53 apps with vulnerable versions with known CVEs between Sept. 2013 and May 2020, with 14 of those apps still remaining vulnerable until the end point of our study. We find that app developers took, on average, 528 ± 40 days to apply security patches, while library developers release a security patch after 54 ± 8 days—a 10 times slower rate of update.
