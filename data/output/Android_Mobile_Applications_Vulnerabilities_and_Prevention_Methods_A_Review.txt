# I. INTRODUCTION
Nowadays, people are using mobile applications more than ever, and their lifestyle is more dependent on them for shopping, entertainment, communication and many other areas. With the importance of these applications in our lives, the developers focus on improving the user experience at the expense of security. Mobile users leave a vast amount of sensitive and personal data in mobile devices, such as banking, health, photos, contacts and messages. When permission is granted to mobile applications to access services and data, there will be a potential risk of data gathering by untrustable parties that could harm the user -.
Android is the Operating system for more than 2 billion devices , . It is forecasted that 228 billion mobile applications will be downloaded by 2022 , . Dealing with security issues of android mobile applications is a challenging and complex task , . At the same time, the lack of security awareness among developers increases security vulnerabilities day by day. As a result, mobile application vulnerabilities research has become an insistent necessity .
In general, discovering vulnerabilities in Android applications can be via static and dynamic analysis . Static analysis is achieved by restoring the application's source code, and then the vulnerabilities are identified in the source code. On the other hand, the application is loaded dynamically with dynamic analysis and simulated hacking attacks to detect vulnerabilities -.
This paper studies various vulnerabilities of android applications and their mitigation techniques. The paper is organized as follows. Section II, presents the background of Android and its components. Section III, provides a literature review of the android applications and the security architecture of the applications. Section IV, discusses different types of vulnerabilities and how to prevent them. Also, a comparison is made among the reviewed researches. The assessment and recommendations are provided in the end of this section. Finally, the conclusion is provided in section V.
# II. BACKGROUND THEORY
# A. Android
Android is a Linux based operating system for smart devices. Android is open source and powers phones, tablets, cars and watches. The Linux kernel interacts with the hardware. On top of Linux, there are libraries and Dalvik Virtual Machine, which uses Linux core features such as multi-threading and memory management. The top layer of the Android operating system is the applications and application framework. Mobile applications interact with the phone via APIs -.
# B. Android Run Time
Android Run Time(ART) is a successor to Dalvik Virtual Machine which is used to execute applications written for Android. It takes the Android application and turns its java code to bytecode to be capable of running on a Linux system -.
# C. Android Components
Generally, there are four types of components in Android. Mobile applications could be composed on all of them are less depending on the complexity of the application. Below are the four types of components in Android , , :

# Services
Services are responsible for the background processing associated with the mobile application.
# Broadcast Receiver
The communication between the Android OS and the applications is handled by broadcast receivers.
# Content Providers
They are responsible for handling the data and database management.
# III. LITERATURE REVIEW
There has been a lot of research in the field of mobile applications security. According to , , the number of vulnerabilities of Android Applications continues to grow. These vulnerabilities cause various types of attacks such as denial of service, sniffing, privilege escalation and non-authenticated access. Many participants contribute to the vulnerability market consisting of vendors, Mobile Applications, vulnerabilities, and hunters. The vendors release mobile applications, and the hunters discover the potential vulnerabilities. Hunters might take advantage of these vulnerabilities and sell them in the black market, which will cause damage to the consumers. It is also possible that hunters will inform the vendors to fix the vulnerabilities .
Android Applications can be downloaded from Google Play as well as third-party sites. The downloaded applications are compressed as Android Packages (APK), which includes libraries, metadata and files necessary for the application to be installed and run. In order to protect the privacy of users and prevent malicious acts, Android enforces applications to request permissions from users to access sensitive information. Thus, the efficiency of the permission mechanism, together with the users' understanding, plays an essential role in Android security , . However, Android applications suffer from various threats such as intent spoofing, privilege escalation, phishing and others .
In general, there are various causes for android vulnerabilities, such as libraries and the outdated version of android. According to , , , around 10% of mobile devices are running on Android 4 or lower, which means that millions of devices are vulnerable. These devices need to upgrade to the latest version of android to fix vulnerabilities. Moreover, another cause is the vulnerable libraries, as  stated that more than 50% percent of vulnerabilities in Android applications are due to vulnerable libraries.
# The android security architecture consists of the following:
- Permission Mechanism: By this mechanism, security interfaces such as Phone calls and SMS are protected, meaning that the application needs to have permission to perform an operation such as sending SMS .
- Sandboxing: is a method to isolate application resources from system resources and from the components of other applications on the same device, as in fig. 1 , .
- Access control: with this mechanism, there are a set of rules for reading, writing and executing files by processes .
# Fig 1. Mobile Application Sandboxing
When developing mobile applications, it is important to maintain their security, and the mobile application developers should be aware of the vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them. Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a foundation that focuses on Software and Mobile applications security and lists the vulnerabilities and their mitigation. Below is the list of OWASP top 10 mobile applications vulnerabilities:
# A. Weak Server-Side Controls
Even though most mobile applications are similar to client/server applications that depend on a connection with the server, many mobile application developers do not consider the security concerns of the traditional server-side applications.
Solution: To prevent Weak Server-Side Controls, it is required to scan mobile applications with scanning tools to identify any security vulnerabilities. Generally, automated scanning tools are used. However, manually assessing is sometimes needed to detect any vulnerability which automated scanning tools haven't detected. In addition, it is recommended that mobile application developers follow secure coding standards and practices to reduce security vulnerabilities , .
# B. Insecure Data Storage
Typically, mobile applications developers store client-side personal or sensitive data in databases and files. When these data are stored without a secure mechanism, attackers can get access these data by rooting or jailbreaking the mobile device. Several problems are associated with insecure data storage, such as fraud and identity or credential theft.
Solution: As a common rule, sensitive data should not be stored in mobile applications unless necessary. For instance, the users should use APIs to authenticate instead of storing their credentials on the phone's file system. Furthermore, all local

# H. Security Decisions Via Untrusted Inputs:
files should be encrypted, and the encryption keys should be stored securely , .
# C. Insufficient Transport Layer Protection
This vulnerability means that the network traffic is not protected when data is transferred between the mobile application and the backend.
Solution: The solution to Insufficient Transport Layer Protection is to use TLS to transmit critical information and session tokens. In addition, by utilizing trusted certificates and pinning them into the mobile application service , .
# D. Unintended Data Leakage
Unintended Data Leakage happens when the mobile application developer accidentally stores sensitive data in a location accessible to other mobile applications running on the same device.
Solution: To prevent this vulnerability, it is necessary to block caching and clipboard access , .
# E. Poor Authorization and Authentication
This vulnerability happens when attackers get access to sensitive mobile application data by bypassing the authentication protocol. When mobile applications work offline, they are more vulnerable to these attacks.
Solution: This vulnerability is to ensure that authentication is done on the server-side instead of the client-side and in the offline mode, assigning fewer privileges to mobile application users to avoid unauthorized access to sensitive data .
# F. Broken Cryptography
Adopting a faulty or hazardous cryptographic algorithm is an unnecessary risk that could lead to exposed sensitive data. Adopting a non-standard algorithm is risky because a determined attacker may be able to decipher the algorithm and gain access to the protected data. Cryptography is a critical part of data security. Many mobile application developers hardcode the encryption and decryption keys in the application's source code, making them vulnerable to attackers via reverse engineering. Moreover, some cryptographic algorithms are weak and can't protect mobile apps like SHA1 and MD5.
Solution: The solution to broken cryptography vulnerability is to stick to the cryptographic standards and never store sensitive data unless necessary .
# G. Client-Side Injection
The client-side injection causes malicious code to be executed via the mobile app via the mobile device. This malicious code is typically delivered in the form of data that the threat agent sends to the mobile app via various methods. Generally, malicious code is injected by attackers via input data. This code might compromise the system with privileged permissions when it is executed.
Solution: To prevent code injection, the data must be validated, and parameterized queries must be used when accessing the database , .
