# ABSTRACT

Android applications pose many security risks that affect the security and privacy of their users. Adversaries construct different types of malicious applications and use different social engineering approaches to attract users to download and trust these applications. Malicious applications usually request permissions that are not related to their main functionality in order to access sensitive information or resources. Most of users attempt to grant the requested permissions without understanding the potential harm of those applications and how the requested permissions can be misused to disclose their privacy. Therefore, there is a need for a risk assessment model which can intimate the users about the risk level of permissions requested by an application in order to assist users to make the right decision whether to grant or deny a requested permission. This paper proposes Permission Usage and Risk Estimation for Android (PUREDroid) to measure the security risk of Android applications’ permissions and the magnitude of harm resulting from granting extraneous permissions requests. In an evaluation with more than 25000 applications, including 5773 malware applications and 19242 benign applications, we demonstrate the usefulness and the effectiveness of our proposed scoring method.

# 1. INTRODUCTION

Among different smartphone platforms, Android has become the most prevalent and fastest growing platform [16]. Android devices, of which millions are in use today, are attractive target for adversaries. Therefore, a worth considerable effort is ensuring the Android operating system security, which has imposed a significant interest among researchers to alleviate its threats. Built-in security mechanisms in Android operating system (OS) provide various levels of protection for data and applications. For instance, application security is governed by a list of permissions used to permit an application to communicate with public resources (e.g. camera and Bluetooth) or highly privileged APIs (e.g. read or send SMS).

It is essential for an application to access sensitive information in order to operate properly. Thus, during the application development stage, required permissions must be declared. However, Android permission model does not have specific gauges that developers, who even are not fully knowledgeable about permissions, have to follow when they declare their applications’ permissions [17]. Hence, most of Android applications developers requesting multiple permissions that might be unnecessary for the main functionality of their applications. However, most users grant the permissions requested by the applications without understanding the potential harm of those applications and how the requested permissions can be misused to disclose their privacy [7].

Furthermore, the Android permission model does not impede privilege escalation or information leakage. In other words, the permission model is not fine-grained enough to provide sufficient means of control on an application’s activities and specify what private information or resources are accessible to the application [8]. Thus, many attacks could possibly occur by exploiting critical permissions, such as privilege escalation sabotages [14]. These challenges are important because there is no standard of which permissions should be requested by which application. Therefore, applications’ developers can request any permission even if it is not related to the application’s main functionality. Unscrupulous developers are fully aware of the Android permissions model’s vulnerabilities that they can exploit to gain unauthorized access or abuse sensitive resources [11]. This could impose costs on Android users’ privacy if a malicious application uses an overly broad permission to perform inappropriate operations.

Android applications in the marketplaces are classified based on their functionality, referred as category. Applications within the same category should share common features and seek similar intents in general. For instance, requested permissions within applications from the same category are most likely consistent [10]. However, malicious applications perform deviant behavior that is far from what they claim and could request permissions that are not related to their main functionality. Thus, this paper proposes a new assessment method to measure the risk of requested permissions within an application based on the application category.

# Constructing an Optimal Set of Permissions for Each Category

Each permission within an application from the same category will be assigned into one of three security risk regions; low, moderate, or high risk score. Also, this paper argues for the need of Android permission model readjustment to lock down unauthorized operations. Briefly, this paper makes the following contributions:

- Analyzing a dataset of Android applications and investing the usage of Android permissions requested by benign and malicious applications.
- Introducing a new scoring method based on the application category to evaluate the security risks of permissions within an application.
- Conducting extensive evaluation to prove the usefulness and the effectiveness of our scoring method.

The reminder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the background of Android OS. Then, Section 3 provides an overview of the related work. Next, Section 4 explains our methodology and approach in-depth. After that, Section 5 discusses the evaluation and results of our model. Finally, Section 6 concludes our paper and presents our future work.

# 2. BACKGROUND

The security of Android system was designed with multiple layers to deliver flexibility, especially for the developers to build secure applications, and sufficient protection for all users of the platform. Android provides some security mechanisms to protect users, such as application sandbox and permission model [13].

Each application runs in an isolated sandbox. Any application wishes to communicate with another application or access any sensitive resources must have the appropriate permission. Hence, permission model is used to protect the communication between applications and the Android OS and restrict access to sensitive information, which would be otherwise compromised [19]. Applications’ developers have to declare all permissions they need for the application in the AndroidMainfest.xml file to be granted by the user [4].

In addition, run time permissions were introduced to allow applications to request permissions as needed at run time. However, the permission model can grant an over-privileged permission to an application because a single permission handles a varying set of APIs. For example, if READ_PHONE_STATE permission is granted to an application, the application can obtain varying phone information, such IMEI, SIM card serial number, Sim card operator, and device ID [3]. Consequently, applications can access more resources than what they need and the user cannot approve a part of this permission.

# 3. RELATED WORK

In this section, variety of research attempts are discussed, which have proposed the concept of risk scoring to evaluate Android applications and permissions. The pattern of application’s permission request has been studied to generate risk indication to improve users’ awareness for the potential malicious activities. For instance, Gates et al. [9] introduced a new method to generate risk signals based on the permissions requested by an application to provide users with feedback about why the application is risky. The risk score is measured using different Bayesian probabilistic models to satisfy three goals, namely, monotonicity, coherence, and ease. Based on their experimental results, the authors stated that using Naive Bayes with informative Priors (PNB) generates a better risk score comparing to the other Bayesian probabilistic models. However, the authors consider a limited set of Android permissions in their study. Another limitation is that the malware dataset used to evaluate their method is very small and the applications categories are unknown comparing to the used benign dataset, which can impact the reliability of their approach.

Deypir [5] proposed a new approach to measure the security risk score of Android permissions based on the concept of information theory and entropy. For each individual permission, the information gain is computed by calculating the entropy of the entire used dataset and the entropy of the permission within the dataset. In this approach, larger risk score is assigned to the permission that are more informative. However, the author neglected the applications categories of the analyzed applications, which negatively affect the risk score since applications from different categories represent different functionality. In addition, information gain has symmetric property, which can incorrectly assign a high risk score to a permission that is mostly used by benign applications.

Furthermore, Wang et al. [20] proposed DroidRisk, a quantitative method to compute the risk of Android applications and permissions. The risk score is calculated based on the potential impact as well as the type of the permission whether it is a normal permission or dangerous permission. The authors used a static weight to represent the impact of a permission based on the permission category, 1 for normal permission category and 1.5 for dangerous permission category. However, measuring the impact of a permission based on applied static weight is inadequate and could affect the validity of the risk score [12]. Similarly, Dini et al. [6] introduced MAETROID, a framework that evaluate the applications requested permissions along with its metadata. The permission risk score is computed by assigning a static weight to each requested permission based on the permission threat category. However, the authors did not provide any empirical evaluation and analysis of their proposed framework.

In addition, Shen et al. [15] introduced a risk assessment model to evaluate the risk of permissions requested by an application according to the application category. The risk score is measured by calculating the number of applications requesting a specific permission within the same category over the number of applications requesting the same permission for all categories. However, the calculation of a permission risk score depends on how frequent this permission requested by other categories, which have different functionality compared to the inspected category. Consequently, a permission could have a low risk score because it was frequently requested by other categories, however, it could be risky to be granted for an application in the inspected category since the functionality of this category does not require such permission to work properly.

To overcome these limitations, PUREDroid is proposed to evaluate the risk of permissions within an application based on the application category and provide the users with a risk region for each permission to help them making the right decision whether to grant or deny the requested permission.

# 4. PROPOSED RISK ASSESSMENT MODEL

The goal of this research is to introduce a reliable method to measure the security risk of Android permissions requested by applications and the magnitude of harm resulting from granting extraneous permissions. This method can be utilized to evaluate the risk of each permission based on a constructed optimal set of permissions for each application’s category. This section describes the proposed PUREDroid, a risk assessment model which is essential to reveal the privacy risk of an application based on its re-

quested permissions.

In order to measure the risk score of a permission in PUREDroid, the non-requested and requested permissions of applications within the same category are represented by two orthonormal states vectors |0⟩ and |1⟩, respectively, as follows:

|0⟩ = (01), |1⟩ = (10) (1)

Every permission is characterized by how many times is requested by both benign and malware applications and represented by two vectors, |m⟩ for malware and |n⟩ for benign as shown in Equation 2. The components of vectors |m⟩ and |n⟩ are depicted on Figure 1.

|𝑚⟩ = 𝛼|0⟩ + 𝛽|1⟩ = (𝛽𝛼), |𝑛⟩ = 𝛾|0⟩ + 𝛿|1⟩ = (𝛿𝛾) (2)

The coefficients 𝛼, 𝛽 and 𝛾, 𝛿 are the 𝑥 and 𝑦 components of vectors |m⟩ and |n⟩, respectively. They satisfy the normalization conditions as shown in Equation 3.

𝛼2 + 𝛽2 = 1, 𝛾2 + 𝛿2 = 1 (3)

These coefficients are related to the occurrence probabilities described by the formulas in Equations 4. 𝑃𝑚 is given by the ratio of the number of malware applications for a selected permission to the number of the entire malware dataset. Similarly, 𝑃𝑛 is given the ratio of the number of benign applications for selected permission to the number of the entire benign dataset.

𝛼 = √(1 − 𝑃𝑚) 𝛽 = √𝑃𝑚 (4)

𝛾 = √(1 − 𝑃𝑛) 𝛿 = √𝑃𝑛

The vectors |m⟩ and |n⟩ are used to construct a risk vector based on the following steps:

First, a two dimensional vector states are extended to three dimensional vectors with the 𝑧 component equals to zero such that

|𝑚⟩ = (𝛽), |𝑛⟩ = (𝛿) (5)

0 0

Second, the cross product |n⟩ × |m⟩ is computed where its 𝑖𝑡ℎ component is given by

(|𝑛⟩ × |𝑚⟩)𝑖 = 𝜖𝑖𝑗𝑘|𝑛⟩𝑗|𝑚⟩𝑘 (6)

Where 𝜖𝑖𝑗𝑘 is commonly known as the Levi-Civita symbol and the Einstein summation convention is used. The indices 𝑖, 𝑗, 𝑘 ∈ {1,2,3} correspond to vector components. The only non-zero component of the cross product |n⟩ × |m⟩ is in 𝑧 direction, which has the following form:

(|𝑛⟩ × |𝑚⟩)3 = 𝜖3𝑗𝑘|𝑛⟩𝑗|𝑚⟩𝑘 = |𝑛⟩1|𝑚⟩2 − |𝑛⟩2|𝑚⟩1 = 𝛾𝛽 − 𝛼𝛿 (7)

= √(1 − 𝑃𝑛)𝑃𝑚 − √(1 − 𝑃𝑚)𝑃𝑛

The cross product |n⟩ × |m⟩ in positive direction is depicted on Figure 2.

Third, the z component of cross product can have both negative and positive values lies in the interval [−1, 1]. Therefore, the z component of |n⟩ × |m⟩ is re-scaled to the set of values [0, 1] and is used as a scaled risk measurement function 𝑟(𝑃𝑚, 𝑃𝑛) described by

𝑟(𝑃𝑚, 𝑃𝑛) = (1+√(1−𝑃𝑛)𝑃𝑚−√(1−𝑃𝑚)𝑃𝑛)2 (8)

One can see that when 𝑃𝑚 = 0, (i.e, a permission is not requested by any malware) the risk function is reduced to the following form:

𝑟(𝑃𝑚 = 0, 𝑃𝑛) = (1−√𝑃𝑛)2 (9)

It is obvious that the risk function should be zero in the case when 𝑃𝑚 = 0 independently of 𝑃𝑛 (permission requested by benign applications). Therefore, there is a need to introduce a proper weight function 𝑤(𝑃𝑛, 𝑃𝑚) defined as

𝑤(𝑃, 𝑃𝑚) =(𝑃𝑚(𝑃𝑚)2 𝑛)2+(𝑃𝑛2) (10)

This leads to the expression for the weighted risk function R, which can be written in the following form:

𝑅 = 𝑤 (1+√(1−𝑃𝑛)𝑃𝑚−√(1−𝑃𝑚)𝑃𝑛)2 (11)

and if 𝑃𝑚 = 0, the weighted risk function R is always zero for any 𝑃𝑛 > 0, as indicated previously.

The algorithm pseudo code of PUREDroid is illustrated in Algorithm 1 and the symbols used are presented in Table 1. This algorithm calculates the risk score of all permissions requested by an application A by obtaining four parameters, which are the benign applications set 𝑆B, the malware applications set 𝑆M, the set of permissions 𝑆P, and the inspected application A. Next, the usage of permission 𝑃i is counted and accumulated in 𝑃n for benign applications and 𝑃m for malware applications, which are essentially needed to compute the risk score of the permissions. After that, the risk of each permission is gauged by computing the cross product |n⟩ × |m⟩ and re-scaled to avoid negative values. Then, the weight

is computed. Finally, the risk score R of the permission is computed by multiplying the computed weight w by the risk function r.

categories are the most targeted categories by malware according to a report from Symantec lab [18].

To extract all permissions within an application, each Android Application Package (.apk) of the inspected applications are analyzed through a static analysis technique. The static analysis is performed to disassemble and convert the APK contents to a readable format using apktool [1]. Once the APK is disassembled, the information about the .apk and its AndroidMainfest.xml file is retrieved. By examining all the requested permissions by all applications within the same category, it was obvious that every category has different set of permissions. Figure 3 illustrates the number of requested permissions for every category.

|𝑆𝑃|Set of permissions|
|A|Application|
|𝑃𝑖|Permission|
|𝑃𝑛|Number of benign applications use permission 𝑃𝑖|
|𝑃𝑚|Number of malware applications use permission 𝑃𝑖|

After analyzing the permissions, the risk function assigned the permissions with different scores based on the number of times a permission was requested by benign and malware applications as depicted in Figure 4. The risk score can belong to one of three regions, which are Low risk region, Moderate risk region, or High risk region. These regions are introduced by the following cases:

# 5. EVALUATION AND RESULTS

PUREDroid is evaluated on a dataset obtained from AndroZoo [2], which is the largest publicly available benign and malware dataset for Android. After persistent effort, more than 25000 applications, including 5773 malware applications and 19242 benign applications, from AndroZoo dataset were analyzed and labeled to evaluate our distinct model. Those applications belong to seven categories, namely, Lifestyle, Music & Audio, Books & Reference, Entertainment, Tools, Education, and Photography.

These categories and the risk function 𝑅 is increasing as 𝑃𝑚 is growing and for 𝑃𝑚 = 1, 𝑅𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 𝑅(1,0) = 1. Thus, all values of 𝑅(𝑃𝑚, 𝑃) ∈ (0.5,1] is considered as high risk region.

• Case1: When 𝑃𝑛 = 𝑃𝑚 , 𝑅 = 0.25 . For any 𝑃𝑚 ≤ 𝑃𝑛 , 𝑅(𝑃𝑚, 𝑃) ∈ [0,0.25] is considered as a low risk region.

• Case2: For 𝑃𝑛 = 0 the limit behave as follows 𝑃𝑚→0lim𝑅(𝑃𝑚, 0) = 2 (12)

• Case 3: This case is the consequence of the boundary behave of the risk function 𝑅 discussed in cases 1 and 2. Thus, for any value 𝑅(𝑃𝑚, 𝑃𝑛) ∈ (0.25,0.5] is considered as moderate risk region.

The effectiveness of our model was tested by computing the risk score of all permissions requested by the applications in the dataset. Due to the limited pages of the paper, only result and evaluation of Books & Reference category is discussed. Therefore, it is clearly seen from Figure 5 and Table 2 that PUREDroid assigned high risk scores to the permissions that are significantly requested by malware applications within Books & Reference category. On contrary, the permissions that are significantly requested by benign applications were assigned to lower risk scores.

Figure 5. Example of the risk scores and regions of the permissions based on our dataset.

Most of the permissions, especially the ones frequently requested by malware applications, have potential security and privacy risk, such as personal information leakage or financial loss. As shown in Figure 6, malware applications usually request permissions that can potentially harm the user privacy, such as identifying the user location, accessing user messages, and changing the device setting. Granting those permissions can effectively give the application the power to access critical resources. Therefore, PUREDroid assigned the permissions that are frequently requested by malware applications and rarely by benign applications with high risk to avoid and mitigate such risks. This can help the user to understand the level of risk of the permissions requested and if these permissions have high risk regardless of the application, the user should deny them.

To fairly and accurately evaluate our model and show how it efficiently assigns high risk scores to permissions that are mostly requested by malware applications, PUREDroid was compared to a previously proposed work by [5]. For this evaluation, same dataset is used to evaluate both methods, which includes top downloaded 600 benign applications and 200 malware applications from the same category. As shown in Table 3, based on PUREDroid model, ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION was assigned to the highest risk score because it was frequently requested by malware applications. On the other hand, WAKE_LOCK was assigned to the lowest risk score since it was frequently requested by benign applications. Furthermore, using Deypir method [5], READ_PHONE_STATE and WAKE_LOCK were assigned to the same risk score. However, READ_PHONE_STATE was frequently requested by malware applications compared to WAKE_LOCK, which was frequently requested by benign applications. Practically, the risk score of READ_PHONE_STATE permission should not only be different from the risk score of WAKE_LOCK permission, but also much higher, which was not achieved by Deypir method [5] due to the symmetric property. In contrast, PUREDroid accurately assigned different risk score for the aforementioned permissions.

# 6. CONCLUSION

Android applications pose many potential risks that may harm users’ privacy. Malicious applications usually request permissions that are not related to their main functionality to access sensitive resources. Therefore, ordinary users grant permissions without understanding the potential harm that may occur upon using those applications. Therefore, it is imperative to assess the security risks of nonnotarized applications and the permissions that an application may request through a risk assessment model that can intimate the users about the potential threats an application may pose to users’ privacy. This paper introduces PUREDroid, a risk assessment method that can be used to increase user’s awareness of the risk involved with granting permissions to Android applications. This model has shown that permissions that perform suspicious activities are assigned to high risk scores unlike those of normal activities. In our future work, more features such as API calls and intents will be considered in our model to introduce a sophisticated model to measure the risk score of each application.
