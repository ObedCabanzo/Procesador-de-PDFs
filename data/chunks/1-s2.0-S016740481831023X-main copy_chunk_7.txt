Moreover, we also managed to create a tool which exploits all the found bugs and can be used for security assessment of the current ADB implementations. Our in-depth research resulted in developing ADB protocol extension which protects against all discovered security threats which are not related to the human factor. Even though no malicious software exploit-

Ing identified vulnerabilities has been found in the wild yet, authors are convinced that presented techniques may be used in the targeted attacks performed e.g. by the state-sponsored malware. The main goal of this paper is to raise security awareness of the users, researchers, and security professionals associated with the USB-related attacks and the threat they pose not only for the PCs but also for the USB devices. Simplicity of the utilized attack techniques shows that the myth that there is no need to implement security mechanisms for the USB communication is invalid. This paper also aims at raising awareness of the USB developers to emphasize that the USB protocols, especially those used to provide such a critical functionality like ADB, should be verified in terms of security just like network protocols are.

Our current research had been mostly focused on Android as it is the most popular mobile platform. It is worth noting that there are also other platforms especially iOS and Windows Phone which also use USB connectivity in the USB device mode for the development purposes. Thus the future work should definitely include security assessment of the USB communication protocol on these platforms. Our software stack – USBProxy particularly – seems to be also very inefficient for the high bandwidth use-cases. Current implementation utilizes synchronous API of both libusb and GadgetFS. According to Alan’s research  ...
