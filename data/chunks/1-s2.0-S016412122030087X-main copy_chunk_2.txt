4. Dynamic analysis
4. UI Automation
UI automation is the core component of DCDroid. It makes an app run to the direction that vulnerable code can be executed and avoids meaningless execution. There are three tasks for UI automation components: obtain UI elements and operate them, reduce UI elements and determine priorities, run app and manage UI status. When the app enters an Activity, it needs to get every element of the Activity and extract the attributes of the element, such as the text of the button and the input form of the text box. With the information obtained, the system creates appropriate events to operate elements so that Activity can jump from one to another normally. For example, select events are created for check boxes and input events are created for text boxes. To achieve this goal, we use the AndroidViewClient to manage components. It can get the UI elements, create appropriate events for the UI elements and execute the dynamic operation of a specific app.

4. Acceleration
In order to accelerate the operation, we select only a part of UI elements to execute from similar elements. Through our analysis, we find that it is appropriate to select four to execute for similar elements. This strategy can speed up our dynamic detection process by avoiding meaningless execution of duplicate elements while ensuring that similar UI elements with different code logic are executed.

4. Set proxy
In order to execute a SSL/TLS MITM attack, all traffic between Android clients and servers must be intercepted. We use mitmproxy as a MITM attack tool. Mitmproxy is a proxy tool that forwards requests and executes MITM attacks like a normal proxy. It generates its own fake certificate and sends it to the client to start an attack. We do not add mitmproxy certificates to the host’s trust certificate list, ensuring that only HTTPS traffic generated by vulnerable apps can be established. The biggest advantage of mitmproxy is that it can manage intercepted requests using Python scripts, which helps analyze intercepted requests.

4. Traffic analysis
In the MITM attack tool, we can only get all the traffic intercepted. However, we are not sure which app generates the traffic. Therefore, it is necessary to identify which app generates the traffic. We use Android’s VPNService interface to capture network packets on the client side. The method involves reading data from the virtual NIC and saving or changing packets. By comparing the IP of PID and its URLs, we can get the corresponding relationship between each HTTPS traffic and the app.

The text discusses the analysis of mobile applications for vulnerabilities, focusing on both static and dynamic detection methods. The dataset includes apps from two markets: 360app and Google Play, with a total of 2213 apps analyzed.

In static analysis, the apps were disassembled using apktool, revealing that 30 apps could not be disassembled successfully. The results indicated that 457 apps (20%) contained potentially vulnerable code, while 1726 apps were free from such vulnerabilities.

Dynamic analysis involved running the apps on Android devices to confirm vulnerabilities. The results showed that 245 apps were identified as having certificate validation vulnerabilities, which accounted for 53% of the potentially vulnerable codes. The analysis highlighted the challenges of dynamic detection, including the risk of app crashes during testing.

The text emphasizes the importance of both static and dynamic analysis in identifying vulnerabilities in mobile applications, noting that while static detection can identify potential issues, dynamic analysis is necessary to confirm these vulnerabilities.

The text discusses the analysis of vulnerabilities in mobile applications, particularly focusing on the results obtained from different tools used to detect these vulnerabilities. It highlights the number of vulnerabilities found in various categories of apps, such as News & Books, Finance, and Health & Medical, with a specific emphasis on the percentage of vulnerable apps in the 360app compared to Google Play.

The analysis indicates that the percentage of certificate validation vulnerabilities is higher in 360app (12%) than in Google Play (9%). The authors also mention improvements in their dynamic analysis methods, which have led to a significant reduction in app crashes and execution time. They report a decrease in the average number of crashes per app from 4 to 1 and a reduction in average execution time from 271 seconds to 183 seconds.

Furthermore, the authors randomly selected 30 apps with certificate verification vulnerabilities to analyze their historical versions. They found that many apps with lower versions tend to have vulnerabilities, especially when higher versions exist. The analysis suggests that apps developed by the same organization often share similar vulnerabilities, and older versions may lack proper security measures like SSL/TLS.

Overall, the findings underscore the importance of continuous monitoring and updating of mobile applications to mitigate vulnerabilities, especially those arising from third-party SDKs.

The complexity of the code increases, vulnerabilities are more likely to occur. The use of third-party libraries may also increase such vulnerabilities. Based on our analysis, if a vulnerability is invoked, the probability of fixing it in later versions is very small. For example, only one app has completely fixed a specific vulnerability without introducing new ones.

DCDroid implements automatic detection of digital certificate verification vulnerabilities through static and dynamic detection. While effective, it has limitations. In static detection, we check vulnerable code, such as methods with simple instruction-returns. However, some code may have complex implementations that ultimately do not conduct verification, leading to false negatives. Compared to other tools like AndroBugs, DCDroid does not show better results in static detection, likely due to different detection rules. However, DCDroid can reduce false positives with dynamic analysis.

In dynamic detection, to speed up execution, we delete similar UI components. Although this generally does not change detection results, we cannot estimate the number of false negatives caused by this deletion. Additionally, some dynamic analyses require specific trigger conditions, which may also lead to false negatives.

Static analysis can detect other vulnerabilities if detection rules are defined. Dynamic analysis can be used for other detections, but it requires specific verification methods, such as setting a proxy for SSL/TLS vulnerability detection. Developers should be cautious during development and adhere to specifications, especially when referencing third-party libraries.

Information security has been widely studied, with privacy issues such as identity privacy and search privacy being significant research topics. Various models and algorithms have been proposed to address privacy concerns, including rank-based attack models and tools for detecting fraud and malware in Android apps. Studies have shown various privacy problems and proposed solutions for pattern privacy leakage and other security issues in Android ecosystems.

The text discusses various tools and methods for analyzing vulnerabilities in Android applications, particularly focusing on SSL/TLS vulnerabilities. It highlights the limitations of existing tools, such as their inability to dynamically trigger vulnerabilities or their reliance on manual analysis. The authors propose a new tool called "DCDroid," which aims to identify vulnerabilities in SSL/TLS digital certificate verification in Android systems. They conducted extensive experiments on a large number of apps from Google Play and 360app, revealing a significant percentage of apps with potential security risks. The findings indicate that DCDroid is effective in detecting these vulnerabilities and analyzing the characteristics of vulnerable apps. Future work will focus on developing mechanisms to automatically patch the identified vulnerabilities.
